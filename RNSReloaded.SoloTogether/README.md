# SoloTogether

**Limits online play.**

*Tassha is no longer lone wolf!*
Tassha is now four! Rabbit not win!

## Details
Replaces all multiplayer patterns with solo patterns.
Most patterns work as intended. Baited patterns will usually target random players.
Many effects placed on players will be the same for the entire party. Some are random.

Blush's 2nd to last attack can be much more unintuitive to dodge. It is reccomended to save a defensive for this.

## Permadeath
By default, when a player dies, they can no longer revive. In subsequent battles, they will immediately die upon entry.

### Adorable
An option is available for casual players which disables all the permadeath features.
In order to properly play, ensure that all players in the party have the same configuration.
